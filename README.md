# preGS.jl

preGS.jl is a pre-genomic processor for analysis in animal breeding. 

preGS.jl was based on `preGSf90` by Ignacio Aguilar in the [BLUPF90](http://nce.ads.uga.edu/wiki/doku.php) 
family of programs. You can find the documentation for preGSf90 [here](http://nce.ads.uga.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=readme.pregsf90). 

Ignacio is a very talented programmer and scientist and this is my poor starting attempt 
at copying his program in Julia from scratch. I'd like to write it in a way that is more flexible
from the beginning, such as input formats and output formats. Ignacio has incorporated some of
this into his package. 

-------

I'm not making this a package through the package manager quite yet, 
but in time I hope I can make it available through the package manager. 
To make it easier. For now, you can simply copy the function to your
own computer. 

## Limitations

I have only tested this on Ubuntu 16.04 (Linux). I will continue to test on other 
computers as I have time.
